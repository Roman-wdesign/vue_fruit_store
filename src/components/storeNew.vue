          <h4>Product delivery</h4>
          <p>We deliver the order to the address provided at the time of ordering. Buyers are solely responsible for
            verifying the accuracy of delivery addresses, and The Orange shall have no liability or responsibility for
            any
            erroneous addresses.</p>
          <p>We will do our best to deliver your order on time, however delivery times may be affected by factors beyond
            our control and therefore cannot be guaranteed. We will do our best to inform you if we become aware of a
            sudden or unexpected delay in delivery.</p>
          <p>We do our best to deliver all your orders, however in some situations we may not be able to fulfill a full
            or
            partial delivery of your order. We reserve the right to cancel orders based on delivery locations or
            availability of products. We will notify you of any such cancellation or change to your order delivery.</p>
          <p>During delivery, the customer must be present to receive the order from our driver. Should the customer be
            unavailable to receive and collect at the address specified in the system on the agreed date of delivery,
            the
            order shall not be delivered to any other location and the customer will be liable for the delivery cost.
            The
            client will need to reschedule a delivery at their own expense, and a new delivery date will need to be
            arranged. We reserve the right to
            change our delivery fees at any time.</p>
          <p>Customers are under no obligation to tip drivers but our drivers are allowed to accept tips and customers
            have the option of doing so at their discretion.</p>
